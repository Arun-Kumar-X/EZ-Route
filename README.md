# EZ-Route - Smart Bus Transit Information System

- A real-time bus tracking and information display system designed to improve the commuting experience for all, especially in public transport where bus arrival times and routes are often unclear.

---

## Introduction

In the public transit system, particularly for bus commuters, many face difficulties in knowing the exact arrival time of buses at stops and understanding available routes. This often leads to confusion, dependency on others, or excessive reliance on smartphone applications.

To address this issue, our team has developed a prototype that provides:
- **Real-time bus location**
- **Approximate arrival times at each bus stop**
- **Visual route indicators** to assist even those with limited literacy.

---

## Problem Statement

Currently, accessing real-time bus location and estimated arrival time without a smartphone app is challenging. This causes delays and uncertainty in daily commutes.

---

## Solution Overview

We propose a cost-effective system featuring:
- **TM1637-based time display modules** at bus stops for ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival).
- **Static route maps with LED indicators** showing the current bus position in real-time.

This allows all commuters, regardless of literacy level, to access necessary bus information independently.

## Technologies Used

- Arduino IDE  
- Python GUI with Tkinter   
- GPS Module  
- TM1637 Time Display  
- LEDs  

---

## Applications

- Empowers **self-reliant commuting** without needing smartphones or external assistance.
- **Reduces waiting time** and confusion at bus stops.
- Ensures **accessibility for all**, including the elderly and non-literate passengers.

---

## Future Scope

- **AI integration** to calculate bus speed, monitor traffic, and improve arrival time accuracy
- **Real-time seat availability display** within buses.
- **In-bus displays** to show time remaining to reach upcoming stops.
